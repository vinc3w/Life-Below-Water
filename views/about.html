To address these issues, Malaysia has implemented environmental regulations and monitoring mechanisms, though the challenges persist.The website provides a wealth of background information, including statistics, data, and real-life stories to illustrate the extent and impact of ocean pollution. Additionally, the site emphasizes the urgent need for action, encouraging visitors to get involved in various ways, from supporting local initiatives to advocating for policy changes. Ultimately, it seeks to raise awareness, inspire action, and foster a greater sense of responsibility in safeguarding Malaysia's precious marine ecosystems.</p>
